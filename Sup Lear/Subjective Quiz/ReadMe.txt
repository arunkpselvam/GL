Dear Participant

Please find below the subjective quiz for Supervised Learning. Kindly submit it before the deadline.

Load the file “imports-85.data” into a dataframe from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/autos/imports-85.dataLinks to an external site. and column names of this data set can be found here --https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/autos/imports-85.namesLinks to an external site.
Explain the problem statement. What are you predicting and what attributes you have to predict?
Browse a sample record from the dataframe. Are there any missing values?
How many records are available in the data set and how many attributes. Do you think the depth (number of records) is sufficient given the breadth? In other words, is the sample likely to be a good representative of the universe?
Analyse the data distribution for the various attributes and share your observations.  
Are there any independent attributes which have |R| close to 1?
Which attributes seem to have stronger relation with the dependent variable (Price of the car)?
Given the above analysis, which algorithm is likely to give a better accuracy? Why?
Additional Pointers:

Hint for Q6 and Q7 - "use the corr method (correlation) defined for pandas dataframe to answer these 2 questions after dealing with missing values."
