Seismic Analytics:
Suppose you have just become the Development Lead for a company which specializes in
reading seismic data which measure earthquake magnitudes around the world. There are
thousands of such sensors deployed around the world recording earthquake data in log files, the
following format:
Src,Eqid,Version,Datetime,Lat,Lon,Magnitude,Depth,NST, Region

Example:
nc,71920701,1,”Saturday, January 12, 2013 19:43:18 UTC”,38.7865,-
122.7630,1.5,1.10,27,“Northern California”

Each entry consists of lot of details. The items in red are the magnitude of the earthquake and
the name of region where the reading was taken, respectively.
Your Director of Software asks you to perform a simple task: for every region where sensors
were deployed, find out the highest magnitude of the earthquake recorded.

Questions:
Write Java MR job to find out the highest magnitude of the earthquake recorded for each region.
OR
Write pseudo code for this job. You need to provide answers for following question in the pseudo
code.
A. Which input format class should be used?
B. What will be input key and value to Mapper&#39;s map() method?
C. What will be logic written inside mapper&#39;s map() method?
D. What will be output key and value for mapper&#39;s map() method?
E. What will be input key and value to Reducer&#39;s reduce() method?
F. What will be output key and value of Reducer&#39;s reduce() method?

Please note:

Submit a .doc or .pdf file having the Java code or pseudo code
Format of file name should be -- YourName_BDH_SubjectiveQuiz.extension
