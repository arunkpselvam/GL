‘John and Bob are brothers.’

D2

‘John went to the store. The store was closed’.

D3

‘Bob went to the store too.’


    Create the term document matrix with TF-IDF as the entries

    b) What is term frequency? How many different ways can it be calculated? What are the implications of different ways of calculating?

    c) What is the implication of using ‘stopwords’ during the textmining? What is the positive impact? What are the possible negative impacts?

    d) Recreate the term-document matrix in exercise (a) after using stopwords for the words (and, are, the, to).  What do you see now in the resulting tdm?
